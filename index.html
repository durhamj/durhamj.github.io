            <h2>Compositional Periods</h2>
            <h3>Russian Period (1913–1920)</h3>
            <p>During this period, Stravinsky's music was heavily influenced by Russian folk music and poetry. His early ballets for the Ballets Russes, such as *The Firebird* and *The Rite of Spring*, are the most famous works from this time.</p>
            <h3>Neoclassical Period (1920–1951)</h3>
            <p>Stravinsky turned towards classical forms and traditions, incorporating Greek mythology and early music structures. Works like *Oedipus Rex* and *Apollon musagète* showcase this shift.</p>
            <h3>Serial Period (1954–1968)</h3>
            <p>In the final phase of his career, Stravinsky embraced twelve-tone technique and serialism, influenced by the work of Arnold Schoenberg. *In Memoriam Dylan Thomas* and *Canticum Sacrum* are key works of this period.</p>
